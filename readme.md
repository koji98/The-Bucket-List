The Bucket List is a site for those looking to get into something new! Whether it be a
solo activity or something to do with friends, you can find the most enjoyable activity
here!

# How It Works

Users will come to the main page and be presented with different topics of things they could
dive deeper into. These topics include:

1. Adventure
2. Art
3. Eating
4. Gaming
5. Music
6. Sports
7. Technology
8. Thrill

After showing interest for a topic by clicking into it, before you see the suggestions
of the best activities to get a deeper for that topic, a series of questions are asked
to see if you are in the right place. This is to help users get the most out of every
page without having them waste time in something they will most likely not be interested
in.

In the topics page you can find the multiple suggestions of the best activities to fill your
interest.
